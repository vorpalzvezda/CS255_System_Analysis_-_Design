# CS255_System_Analysis_-_Design
- A collection of submissions regarding SDLC, UML, and design decisions for the DriverPass scenario. 

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
- The company DriverPass identified a gap in the market for prospective student drivers seeking effective preparation for DMV testing. In order to address this shortfall, the company proposed the development of a cloud-hosted digital platform that integrates online learning with in-person driver training. The system would provide DMV-regulated study materials, practice testing, progress tracking, personalized instructor feedback, and administrative tools to enhance business operations. The goal of these features is to improve student pass rates, increase customer satisfaction, and capture a larger share of the driver training market. 

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- If I could revise one part of my DriverPass documentation, I would change the requirements section. Specifically, the inclusion of nonfunctional requirements. I find nonfunctional requirements to be largely redundant and of limited practical use in the design process. These tend to restate obvious expectations, such as "the system should be reliable" or "the interface must be user-friendly," without providing meaningful and measurable influence on architectural decisions.
- If I were to revise this section, I would either remove nonfunctional requirements entirely or replace them with design constraints and specific quality metrics that better inform implementation. This would make the documentation more concise, relevant, and actionable for developers.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- Since I did not have direct communication with actual students or instructors, I primarily interpreted user needs through the DriverPass transcript. This meant understanding the system's goals and challenges through the lens of administrative and operational perspectives. My focus was identifying what the client needed to effectively deliver services, such as scheduling tools, progress tracking, user management features, and interface elements. 
- Designing strong administrative functionality, so that the system can operate efficiently and consistently, results in the direct benefit to students. An organized back-end ensures that instructors can manage lessons, monitor progress, and deliver constructive feedback without technical barriers. This ultimately creates a smoother and more reliable experience for end-users. Considering user needs, whether administrative or student, was essential because design decisions affect usability and satisfaction. This assessment determines the overall success of the system once deployed. 

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
- When approaching system design, I start by evaluating the tools that will support the project, specifically the programming languages, frameworks, and infrastructure best suited for deployment. These choices are guided by the technical knowledge of the end users, the organizations available resources, and the long-term financial impact of maintaining the system. A tool that's easy to develop with but costly to host or difficult for staff to manage can undermine the system's sustainability, so early design decisions are foundational to both implementation and success. 
- The selected tools also shape the design strategy itself. They influence how I structure diagrams, define system components, and organize classes or services. Understanding the technical ecosystem helps ensure that the system's architecture remains cohesive, scalable, and realistic to deploy. 
- Looking to the future, I would like to refine my approach by simplifying the number of tools and languages involved in development. My goal is to move toward a unified design environment, a single versatile syntax capable of handling every layer of a deployed system. From interface to infrastructure, this approach would promote consistency, reduce complexity and technical overhead, and streamline development through a system's lifecycle.
